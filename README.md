A Python-based Campus Energy Dashboard that analyzes and visualizes campus energy consumption data.
This project uses pandas for data processing, matplotlib for visualizations, and pathlib for safe file-system handling.
The code is structured using classes and functions to keep it modular, clean, and scalable.

Library            Module	Purpose
pandas	          Data loading, cleaning, and analysis
matplotlib       	Visualization / plotting
pathlib          	Safe and OS-independent file path utilities
